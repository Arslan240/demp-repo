#Demo

Description:
I am learning to use git and github that's why this demo-repo thingy is being made. So I hope it all goes well.

After deleting the previous line Now I am adding a new line

##Subheader

Adding subheader and new line of code potentially.

1- git status = this command will show us all the untracked or saved  files that we have created but not saved or commited, something like that.

2- git add . = this command will tell the git to track all the untracked files and save them. 
    '.' the period here is used for all the files. Alternatively we could write the name of the specific file that we want to commit.

3- git commit -m = This command will commit the saved changes to the github repository. 
    '-m' after this inside "" we write the title of the commit.
    '-m' if we want to add the description of that commit we then add another , -m "description of the commit". 

4- git push origin master = this is something I have no idea what it is.
